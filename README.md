**SecGate** orchestrates five industry-standard security scanners — **Semgrep, Gitleaks, osv-scanner, Trivy, and npm audit** — behind a single command. It normalizes their output into one report and fails the pipeline on CRITICAL or HIGH findings. No account. No telemetry. No data leaves your machine — except for the vulnerability lookups the wrapped scanners perform (see [Network access](#network-access)).

**Honest positioning.** SecGate is a **triage accelerator**, not a defect oracle. Dogfooded against a 2,628-file production codebase: **1,858 → 46 actionable findings — 98% noise demoted**. The wrapped scanners are each noisy in isolation (industry estimate: ~70% of raw SAST/SCA output is signal-less). SecGate's job is to surface what's actionable and demote the rest — see [What we demote (and why)](#what-we-demote-and-why).

**Status.** Early release (`v0.2.14`). Releases publish from GitHub Actions with npm trusted publishing and provenance. Report vulnerabilities via [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

**Accuracy contract.** SecGate's aggregation pipeline is deterministic — same inputs produce JSON-byte-identical findings, score, and gate status across every run. Two test suites lock the contract:

- `test/determinism.mjs` — JSON byte-equality across reruns, order-stable dedup, override + ignore applied identically.
- `test/golden-secgate.mjs` — hand-crafted 11-finding fixture; expected counts, score (`22`), and gate status are inline so any change surfaces in code review.

Full pipeline spec lives in [`docs/aggregation.md`](docs/aggregation.md).

---

## Security Score

Every run now produces a **Security Score (0–100)** in addition to the binary PASS/FAIL gate. The score is deterministic: same findings → same score every time.

```
Security Score: 62 / 100   ████████████░░░░░░░░  rule v1

  Semgrep      97 / 100   ███████████████████░
  Gitleaks     75 / 100   ███████████████░░░░░
  npm audit    90 / 100   ██████████████████░░
  osv-scanner 100 / 100   ████████████████████
  Trivy        62 / 100   ████████████░░░░░░░░
```

Penalty per finding: CRITICAL −25 · HIGH −10 · MEDIUM −3 · LOW −1 · INFO/UNKNOWN 0. Floor: 0. Color thresholds: green ≥ 90, amber ≥ 70, red < 70. The binary gate (exit 1 on CRITICAL/HIGH) is unchanged. `securityScore` and `toolScores` are also written to `secgate-v7-report.json` for CI dashboards and trend tracking.

---

## TL;DR

```bash
npx @stelnyx/secgate .
```

Runs all five scanners against the current directory, writes a JSON report, a self-contained HTML report, and (optionally) SARIF. Exit `0` on clean, `1` on CRITICAL/HIGH findings. That's the whole product.

---

## What it does today

SecGate wraps five existing open-source scanners, runs them against a directory, and produces:

- **One normalized JSON report** across every scanner
- **One self-contained HTML report** with per-scanner tabs, dark mode, zero external assets
- **One SARIF 2.1.0 file** ready for GitHub Code Scanning upload
- **One exit code** — `1` when CRITICAL or HIGH findings are present; blocks CI

SecGate does not ship its own analysis engine. Every finding originates from one of the five underlying tools. The value is **orchestration, normalization, and a single exit code.**

---

## Scanners

| Scanner       | Category                  | Notes                                                                 |
|---------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Semgrep**   | SAST (static code)        | OSS ruleset. 10+ languages. Extend via `customSemgrepRules`. Local.   |
| **Gitleaks**  | Secrets & credentials     | Working tree + git history (when `.git/` present). Secrets redacted. Local. |
| **npm audit** | Node dependencies (SCA)   | Runs when `package.json` present. **Queries the npm registry advisory API (network).** |
| **osv-scanner** | Polyglot SCA            | npm, PyPI, Go, Cargo, Maven, RubyGems, Packagist, NuGet, Pub. **Queries the OSV.dev API (network).** |
| **Trivy**     | IaC + License + Image     | Terraform, Kubernetes, Dockerfile, CloudFormation. Base-image CVEs. **Downloads its vuln DB; pulls image layers for image scans (network).** |

Missing scanner binaries are **skipped gracefully** and noted in the report. No scanner is required; SecGate uses whatever is on `$PATH`.

---

## Network access

SecGate itself makes **no network calls** — no telemetry, no account, no phone-home, and the report is written to local files. But three of the five wrapped scanners need the internet to do their job:

| Scanner | Network use |
|---------|-------------|
| Semgrep | None — runs its ruleset against your files. |
| Gitleaks | None — scans your working tree and git history locally. |
| npm audit | Queries the npm registry's advisory API for your dependency tree. |
| osv-scanner | Queries the OSV.dev API for advisories matching your dependency manifests. |
| Trivy | Downloads/updates its vulnerability database; pulls image layers when scanning container images. |

So "no telemetry" is exact; "fully air-gapped" is not — run SecGate offline and `npm audit`, `osv-scanner`, and `Trivy` will degrade or skip (which SecGate reports). On first run, `osv-scanner` and Trivy may download vulnerability databases; SecGate prints a one-line note before starting those scanners so the initial delay is not mistaken for a hang. A first-class offline mode (skip the network scanners, or point them at a local DB mirror) is tracked in the issue backlog.

---

## What we demote (and why)

The HTML report has **two confidence profiles**:

- **`curated` (default)** — actionable findings render inline. Known-noisy patterns get demoted to a collapsed **Informational** block. The exit code (`0`/`1`) is **unchanged** — demotion is presentation-only, not policy.
- **`strict`** — every finding renders inline with no demotion. Use for compliance audits or when tuning the curated rule list.

Curated profile demotes:

| Pattern | Why demoted |
|---------|-------------|
| **License findings** (`type: license` from Trivy) | Trivy flags every dep license (MIT, Apache-2.0, LGPL, etc.) as a finding. License posture is governance/legal, not security — belongs in its own pane, not next to CVEs. |
| **Trivy base-image OS CVEs at LOW/MEDIUM** (`scanMode: image` or `signature: trivy-image:*`) | Rarely reachable from a Node/Python/Go app runtime (`apt-secure`, `libtinfo`, `perl-base`). CRITICAL/HIGH still surface inline. |
| **CVEs >5 years old**, severity != CRITICAL | If upstream hasn't shipped a fix in 5+ years, exploitability is bounded. |
| **`UNKNOWN` severity** findings | Scanner couldn't classify — surfaced for audit, not blocked. |
| **`html.security.audit.missing-integrity`** | Fires on every `<script src>` without an SRI hash, including inline favicon SVGs. Real CDN-MITM risk is covered by HSTS / COEP on most modern stacks. |
| **`path-join-resolve-traversal`** Semgrep rule | Common false positive in CLI tools that legitimately resolve user-supplied paths against a known root. |

**Real-world impact:** dogfood scan of a 2,628-file CirrusTranslate codebase: `1858 → 46` actionable findings (98% noise demoted). Of the 46: 2 CRITICAL + 36 HIGH + 8 LOW. Triageable in one sitting instead of a wall of license rows + base-image CVEs.

Findings are **never dropped** by curated demotion — they're re-classified for display ordering. Suppressed findings (inline `# secgate:ignore` comments) get their own collapsed block with per-rule counts for audit trail.

Toggle via `.secgate.config.json`:

```json
{ "profile": "curated" }   // or "strict"
```

Or via CLI:

```bash
secgate . --profile strict
```

---

## Positioning

SecGate is **not** a SOC platform, a compliance tool, or a vulnerability management system. It is a **CI gate** that aggregates scanner output and fails the build when something critical is found.

| Alternative        | When to pick it instead of SecGate                              |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Trivy standalone** | You only scan containers and don't need SAST or secrets.     |
| **Semgrep OSS**      | You only need SAST with custom rules.                        |
| **Snyk**             | You need a managed vuln DB, triage UX, Jira sync — and budget.|
| **Aikido**           | You want SaaS dashboards and are OK with a hosted account.   |

**SecGate's niche:** zero-config orchestration, local output only, MIT. If you need SaaS-grade triage or compliance workflow, buy Snyk or Aikido. Full matrix: [`docs/comparison.md`](docs/comparison.md).

## Prerequisites

Node.js `>=18`. External scanners are optional — install only the ones you want to run.

```bash
# macOS
brew install semgrep gitleaks osv-scanner trivy

# Linux
pip install semgrep
# gitleaks:    https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks#installing
# osv-scanner: https://github.com/google/osv-scanner#installation
# trivy:       https://aquasecurity.github.io/trivy/latest/getting-started/installation/
```

---

## Install

### From npm (recommended)

```bash
npm install -g @stelnyx/secgate
```

### One-shot via npx (no install)

```bash
npx @stelnyx/secgate .
```

### From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Stelnyx/SecGate.git
cd SecGate
npm install
chmod +x secgate.js
sudo ln -sf "$(pwd)/secgate.js" /usr/local/bin/secgate
```

---

## Usage

```bash
# Scan current directory (dry-run, default)
secgate .

# Scan with auto-remediation (npm audit fix only — see warning below)
secgate . --apply

# Scan with debug output
secgate . --debug

# Scan specific path
secgate /path/to/project

# Write reports to a custom directory (default: the target)
secgate /path/to/project --output-dir /tmp/reports

# Strip absolute paths from the report (auto-on when CI=true)
secgate /path/to/project --strip-paths

# Show all findings inline (skip curated demotion)
secgate . --profile strict

# Raise bounded-walk limits for an unusually large single project
secgate . --max-files 50000 --max-depth 32

# Override workspace detection when you intentionally scan many sub-projects
secgate /path/to/workspace --allow-workspace

# Version / help
secgate --version
secgate --help
```

SecGate is designed for a single project target. Before launching external
scanners, it performs a bounded preflight walk that skips dependency, VCS,
vendor, and build-output directories (`node_modules`, `.git`, `dist`, `build`,
`coverage`, `vendor`, and common package-manager caches). Symlinks are skipped,
large files are not parsed, and the walk is capped by `--max-files`,
`--max-depth`, `--max-file-size`, and `--walk-timeout-ms`. If the target looks
like a workspace with multiple sub-projects and no root `package.json`, SecGate
exits with a clear message unless `--allow-workspace` is supplied.

**Exit codes**

| Code | Meaning                                            |
|:----:|----------------------------------------------------|
| `0`  | PASS — no CRITICAL or HIGH findings                |
| `1`  | FAIL — CRITICAL or HIGH findings present           |
| `2`  | Invalid target or CLI error                        |

---

## Security — `--apply` in untrusted repos

> **⚠ `--apply` executes remediations (`npm audit fix`) inside the scanned repo.** Treat this as code execution against the target. **Only use it on code you trust.**

**Hardening already in place:**

- Every npm invocation under `--apply` passes `--ignore-scripts` — malicious `preinstall` / `postinstall` scripts in the target's `package.json` (or its dependencies) are **not executed**.
- `--apply` is **gated**: refuses to run unless `SECGATE_CONFIRM_APPLY=1` is set (CI / non-interactive) or the user types `y` at an interactive TTY prompt.
- Every `--apply` execution is recorded in the report's `auditLog` field and mirrored to stderr with timestamp and target.

**Operator guidance:**

- **Do not run `--apply` against untrusted or newly cloned third-party repos.** Run dry-run first, review, decide.
- In CI, prefer dry-run (`secgate .`) and rely on the exit code to gate. If you must `--apply`, do it inside an isolated, ephemeral runner with `SECGATE_CONFIRM_APPLY=1`.
- Report files default to the target directory. Use `--output-dir` to redirect; a warning is printed to stderr when `cwd !== target`.
- In CI, `--strip-paths` is auto-enabled to prevent host paths leaking into uploaded artifacts.

---

## Configuration

Create `.secgate.config.json` in your scan target directory. All fields are optional.

```json
{
  "profile": "curated",
  "failOn": ["critical", "high"],
  "scanners": {
    "semgrep": true,
    "gitleaks": true,
    "npm": true,
    "osv": true,
    "trivy": false
  },
  "severityOverrides": [
    { "rule": "npm-audit.lodash", "severity": "LOW" },
    { "rule": "trivy-DS*", "severity": "MEDIUM" }
  ],
  "ignore": ["CVE-2024-12345", "npm:some-old-package*"],
  "baselineFile": ".secgate-baseline.json",
  "customSemgrepRules": "./rules/"
}
```

A fully-commented example config lives at [`.secgate.config.example.json`](.secgate.config.example.json) — copy into your repo as `.secgate.config.json` and edit.

JSON Schema: [`docs/config.schema.json`](docs/config.schema.json)

### Field reference

| Field                | Type            | Default                    | Description                                                                 |
|----------------------|-----------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `profile`            | `string`        | `"curated"`                | HTML report confidence profile: `"curated"` or `"strict"` (see [demotion table](#what-we-demote-and-why)) |
| `failOn`             | `string[]`      | `["critical","high"]`      | Severity tiers that cause exit `1`                                          |
| `scanners`           | `object`        | all `true`                 | Set any scanner to `false` to skip it                                       |
| `severityOverrides`  | `array`         | `[]`                       | Override severity for matching signatures (glob `*` supported)              |
| `ignore`             | `string[]`      | `[]`                       | Drop findings whose signature matches (glob `*` supported)                  |
| `baselineFile`       | `string`        | `.secgate-baseline.json`   | Path to baseline file (relative to target)                                  |
| `customSemgrepRules` | `string\|null` | `null`                     | Extra `--config=<path>` passed to semgrep                                   |

### Precedence

```
CLI flag  >  .secgate.config.json  >  built-in defaults
```

- `--baseline` and `--update-baseline` are CLI-only (no config equivalent).
- Missing config file: silent, defaults apply. Invalid JSON: error logged, defaults apply.

### Baseline workflow

```bash
# 1. Accept current state as baseline
secgate . --update-baseline

# 2. On subsequent runs, fail only on net-new findings
secgate . --baseline
```

Commit `.secgate-baseline.json` to your repo. Baselined findings appear in reports with a `baseline` marker and are excluded from the fail-gate.

### Inline suppression

Add a comment on the flagged line or the line immediately above:

```js
// secgate:ignore <rule-id>
db.query(userInput);

db.execute(sql); // secgate:ignore my.rule.id

/* secgate:ignore my.rule.id */
dangerousCall();
```

Suppressed findings are excluded from counters. The report's `suppressions` section records per-rule counts for audit.

---

## CI / CD

### GitHub Actions — minimal

```yaml
# .github/workflows/secgate.yml
- name: Run SecGate
  run: npx @stelnyx/secgate .
  # exits 1 on CRITICAL or HIGH findings — blocks the pipeline
```

### Non-blocking (report only)

```yaml
- name: Run SecGate
  run: npx @stelnyx/secgate . || true

- name: Upload report
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
  with:
    name: secgate-report
    path: |
      secgate-v7-report.json
      *.html
```

### As a composite GitHub Action

A composite action is published at `.github/actions/secgate/` in this repo.

```yaml
- name: SecGate Security Gate
  id: secgate
  uses: Stelnyx/SecGate/.github/actions/secgate@main
  with:
    target: "."
    apply: "false"
    fail-on: "critical,high"
    format: "json,html,sarif"

- name: Upload HTML + JSON
  if: always()
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
  with:
    name: secgate-report
    path: |
      secgate-v7-report.json
      *.html

- name: Upload SARIF to Code Scanning
  if: always() && steps.secgate.outputs.sarif-path != ''
  uses: github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v3
  with:
    sarif_file: ${{ steps.secgate.outputs.sarif-path }}
    category: secgate
```

**Action inputs**

| Input     | Default          | Description                                              |
|-----------|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `target`  | `.`              | Directory to scan                                        |
| `apply`   | `false`          | Execute fixable remediations                             |
| `fail-on` | `critical,high`  | Severity levels that fail the step                       |
| `format`  | `json,html`      | Output formats — comma-separated: `json`, `html`, `sarif`|

**Action outputs**

| Output        | Description                                                   |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `report-path` | Path to `secgate-v7-report.json`                              |
| `sarif-path`  | Path to `<repo>.sarif.json` (set only when format includes SARIF) |

**Pin to a full commit SHA** for production workflows:

```yaml
uses: Stelnyx/SecGate/.github/actions/secgate@<full-sha>
```

See [`.github/workflows/example-secgate.yml`](.github/workflows/example-secgate.yml) for a complete reference workflow.

### Releasing SecGate

Package releases are published by the `Publish` GitHub Actions workflow when a
GitHub Release is published. The workflow uses npm trusted publishing through
OIDC, so there is no npm token in GitHub secrets and no local publish step.

Release summary: bump the npm version, commit and push `main`, push a matching
`vX.Y.Z` tag, create a GitHub Release from that tag, then confirm the dependency
guard, workflow, and npm provenance badge. The release path runs
`npm run check:deps` to block accidental `file:`, `link:`, or `workspace:`
dependencies before publish. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#releases)
for the exact checklist and npm Trusted Publisher settings.

---

## SARIF output

SecGate emits [SARIF 2.1.0](https://sarifweb.azurewebsites.net/) alongside JSON and HTML. SARIF is the standard format consumed by GitHub Code Scanning, GitLab SAST, and other platforms.

```bash
secgate . --format sarif
# writes: secgate-v7-report.json, <repo>.html, <repo>.sarif.json
```

The `--format` flag accepts a comma-separated list. `sarif` is **additive** — JSON and HTML are always written:

```bash
secgate . --format json,html,sarif   # same as above
secgate . --format sarif             # also writes JSON + HTML
```

### SARIF structure

- One `runs[]` entry per scanner: `semgrep`, `gitleaks`, `npm`, `osv`, `trivy`, `trivyImage` (6 total).
- Each finding maps to a `result` with `ruleId = signature`, `level` derived from severity, and `locations[].physicalLocation` when file/line data is present.
- `properties["security-severity"]` carries a CVSS-style score for GitHub's sort order: `CRITICAL = 9.5`, `HIGH = 7.5`, `MEDIUM = 5`, `LOW = 2`, `UNKNOWN = 0`.

### Upload to GitHub Code Scanning

```yaml
- name: Run SecGate
  id: secgate
  run: npx @stelnyx/secgate . --format sarif

- name: Upload SARIF
  uses: github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v3
  if: always()
  with:
    sarif_file: <repo-name>.sarif.json
    category: secgate
```

---

## Report output

Each run writes:

- **`secgate-v7-report.json`** — machine-readable, schema below.
- **`<repo-name>.html`** — self-contained HTML report with per-scanner tabs, dark mode, zero external assets. Filename derived from the target directory name.
- **`<repo-name>.sarif.json`** — SARIF 2.1.0 file (only when `--format sarif` is passed).

    }
  ]
}
```

### Severity tiers

Every finding is normalized to one of five tiers at the `addFinding()` ingress:

| Tier        | Meaning                                                                                  |
|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **CRITICAL**| Exploitable now — secrets, CVSS ≥ 9, hardcoded-credential SAST rules                      |
| **HIGH**    | High-impact — CVSS 7.0–8.9, Semgrep `ERROR`, rated `HIGH` upstream                        |
| **MEDIUM**  | Meaningful — CVSS 4.0–6.9, `WARNING`, `MODERATE`                                          |
| **LOW**     | Informational — CVSS < 4.0, `INFO`, `NOTE`                                                |
| **UNKNOWN** | Upstream provided no severity or an unrecognized value — surfaced rather than miscounted |

### Fixability

- `fixableBy: "auto"` — `patch()` returns an executable command; `--apply` will run it (currently only `npm audit fix`).
- `fixableBy: "manual"` — a patch exists but requires human action (upgrade, rotate, refactor).
- `fixable: true` mirrors `fixableBy === "auto"` for CI convenience.

### Tool states

| State       | Meaning                                                                      |
|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `ran`       | Tool executed, findings present                                              |
| `clean`     | Tool executed, no findings                                                   |
| `skipped`   | Tool not installed, or target not applicable (no `package.json`, no lockfile)|
| `error`     | Tool produced output that could not be parsed — re-run with `--debug`        |
| `pending`   | Tool did not run (should not appear in final reports)                        |

## Risk scoring

Findings are scored with static weights applied at ingress:

| Severity | Weight |
|----------|:------:|
| CRITICAL | 10     |
| HIGH     | 6      |
| MEDIUM   | 3      |
| LOW      | 1      |

The `riskScore` in the report is the sum of these weights across all findings. This is a **heuristic count**, not CVSS, not EPSS, not exploit-probability modeling. Use it to compare runs of the same repo over time — not as an absolute posture score.

> **Note — two scores, two purposes.** `riskScore` (here) is an unbounded raw weight kept for backward compatibility with early CI dashboards. The user-facing **[Security Score](#security-score)** (0–100) at the top of this README is the deterministic 0–100 posture metric introduced in `v0.2.x` and is the one to surface in new dashboards.

## Product vision

SecGate is the open-source input layer for a broader security workflow. The **core CLI** — scan orchestration, SARIF output, baselines, suppressions, HTML report — stays **MIT-licensed and free, forever**. Future paid extensions may add hosted dashboards, org-wide policy management, compliance evidence packs, and multi-repo aggregation for teams that need more than a local gate. Those do not exist today. The OSS boundary is defined in [`OPEN-CORE.md`](OPEN-CORE.md).

---

## Tiers (planned)

> **Status:** today's CLI is MIT, single tier — `npx @stelnyx/secgate .` runs the full scan, no flags, no gates. The table below is the planned tier model that aligns SecGate with [LuxScope](https://github.com/Stelnyx/LuxScope) and [LuxFaber](https://github.com/Stelnyx/LuxFaber) — same engine at every tier, paid tiers add presentation, persistence, and governance. **`recon` ships today.** `standard` / `enterprise` arrive when the hosted-link service lands.

| Tier | Scanners | Findings | HTML report | Hosted shareable link | Branded cover | Trend storage |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **recon** | all 5 (Semgrep · Gitleaks · npm audit · osv-scanner · Trivy) | all (curated + strict profiles) | yes (self-contained) | no | no | no |
| **standard** | all 5 | all | yes | yes (persistent URL) | no | yes (per-repo history) |
| **enterprise** | all 5 + custom rule packs | all | yes | yes | yes (logo, client, accent color) | yes (org-wide rollup) |

`recon` is full local analysis — same scanners, same findings, same SARIF output as paid tiers. Paid tier value is **persistence, sharing, and governance**, not analysis depth. The CLI does not gate any scanner output by tier — every CVE, every secret, every IaC misconfig surfaces in `recon`. The MIT core boundary is defined in [`OPEN-CORE.md`](OPEN-CORE.md).
